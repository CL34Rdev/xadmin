# xAdmin
A free and basic administration system for Garry's Mod.


## What is xAdmin?
xAdmin is a lightweight and simplistic administration tool made with the intent to fit the gap that is currently made by these heavy and feature rich administation systems currently available on Garry's Mod. xAdmin tries to be lightweight and simplistic by only providing the core features needed.

## Requirements
xAdmin currently requires [MySQLoo](https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO) in order to work. I have intentions to allow it to work internally at some point, but for now it requires [MySQLoo](https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO)

## If it's simplistic, why should I use it?
Systems like [ULX](https://github.com/TeamUlysses/ulx) have the goal to be as feature rich as possible and meet the needs of everyone. xAdmin simply wants to provide the base utilities to help you and your team manage your servers.
